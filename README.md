# 📈 Polynomial Regression in Python with Visualization
This project demonstrates how to use Polynomial Regression with scikit-learn to model non-linear data and visualize the results. The example uses synthetic data to simulate a curved relationship (e.g., y = x²), and shows how well the model fits and predicts future values.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
NumPy for numerical data and array manipulation

scikit-learn for building the polynomial regression model

matplotlib for plotting and visualization
